The data types now supported by Gentry are:

	char
	varchar
	int
	int (auto_increment) - displays next value on screen
	enum - presents enum types in cobmo box to choose item from
	double
	time
	date

There are now a couple sql files here which will create test tables for use
in the code testing.  Feel free to give it a whirl.  

The source is now in CVS so it can be checked out and perused freely.
The current release, 0.1.10, is now yet in CVS however.

There is a new survey that I would like for all of you to fill out and it
can be found from my home page (below).  I have only had 1 person fill this
out and I know there are lots of you guys downloading the code and trying it
out.  So ... I have also included the survey as Survey in the tar.  Please
fill it out and send it in to me if you do not wish to take the online
survey.


I am in need of help to get the automake routines to correctly locate the mysql
install directory to find the headers and libraries.  If anyone wants to 
tackle this, please let me know.
