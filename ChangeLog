Version 0.1

Initial release

Version 0.1.1

Added support for varchar, double, date.

Version 0.1.2

Fixed support for varchar, char and date data types to account for the length 
of the string for input. Also fixed a segfault caused by the query string 
being too small.

Version 0.1.3

Small fix to move focus to the first entry box after insert it done as it is 
quite annoying to have to hit tab 4 times to start the next data entry.

Version 0.1.4

Fixed initial focus so it is now on the first entry field.
Added error checking for bad db and bad table from command line.

Version 0.1.5

Fixed focus so it is now on the first entry field after the form is cleared.
Added initial code for ENUM support.  There is currently no error checking
but I intend to handle this with a drop-down box for the ENUM field in the
near future.

Version 0.1.6

Added code for auto_increment fields so that the next number to be assigned is displayed in
the field and editing of this field is disabled.

Version 0.1.7

Fixed the auto_increment code so that the auto_increment field can be
anywhere in the table definition.  There is still a bug in that if the
program is run against a table with an auto_increment field and there are NO
rows, the program will seg fault.  I have not been able to track this down. 
Any assistance would be appreciated.

Also fixed up the ENUM support so that the ENUM data is displayed in a Combo
entry that allows the user to choose the item wanted.

Version 0.1.8

Added the time datatype to the support list of known fields so that the 
insert automatically adds the quotes correctly.

Added support for username and password as well as offering an optional way
to specify the table and database via the getopt function.  

The new options are:

	-d database
	-t table
	-u username
	-p password
	-v version

Version 0.1.9

Added code to deal with empty table that has a auto_increment primary key.
The problem circumvents this case as it was causing segfault when trying
to get the max(id) from the table (which had 1 row with a NULL value).

Version 0.1.10

Added autoconf/automake code to dynamically look for and configure Mysql
libs and headers.

Version 0.1.11

Added support for timestamp, datetime, year, float datatypes
